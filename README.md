build-comms is a little library that abstracts away our communication / network concerns.

### How to depend on build-comms

In a Ruby project or small script, use Bundler and add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'build-comms',
      :git => "http://github.com/phonegap-build/build-comms.git", :tag => "v1.0.0"

The tag will depend on which release you want to use.
